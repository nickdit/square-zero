## Introduction 
[TODO]

## Steps overview
1. Mark the perimeter
2. Level everything to the lowest corner. We want to move as much soil as we can here, to get as much building material as possible.
3. Dig foundation trenches.
4. Dig hole for composting toilet.
5. Build composting toilet walls.

### Replanteo
#### Materiales necesarios para el replanteo
* Tirantes de 2x4 (sin cepillar):
* Tablas de 1x6 (sin cepillar): 
* 

#### Paso a paso
1. Marcar primera esquina del dormi
  1. Cortar una estaca de 2x4 a 80cm.
  2. Hacerle una punta con un serrucho para que se entierre más fácil.
  3. Ubicar la esquina del dormi que se encuentre más alta en el terreno. Si la diferencia en altura es poca, cualquier esquina sirve. 
  4. Clavar la estaca dejando 40cm fuera de la tierra.
  5. Medir y marcar en la estaca 20cm desde el suelo.
2.  



### Finding material
1. Stones and gravel are perfect in the cob mix. It's just not comfortable to tread with bare feet[^evans-gravel].

### Jar shake tests
[TODO]

### Test bricks[^evans-bricks]
1. Mix a small batch of cob with the materials you intend to use, without straw.
2. Make 3 test blocks in the size of a brick (4 x 8 x 3 inches).
3. Add straw to the rest of the mix, form similar blocks.
4. Dry the bricks in the sun. It might take several days.
5. Brake one brick in half, if it's not dry yet, leave the rest a few more days.
6. Surface cracking indicates too much clay.
7. Try scratching the brick with a knife. If they score deeply or crumble, they are not hard enough.
8. Try breaking a block with straw by twisting it between two hands. It should be impossible.


### Swale
[TODO]

#### Planting clover

[TODO: rewrite]
1. Plant in the fall
2. Use a cereal grain as a cover crop.
3. Mow the next spring with the cereal begins to shade out the clover.
4. Every time your clover hits about 12", mow it back to 6"-8" and try to do it before a rain.
5. If your weeds outgrow your clover, mow to keep the weeds from going to seed.
6. Consider mowing your clover in strips so that if you get a dry spell, deer still have food.

(plant in spring :S http://www.outsidepride.com/resources/planting/clover_instructions.html)
