## Introduction 

## Steps overview
1. Mark the perimeter
2. Level everything to the lowest corner. We want to move as much soil as we can here, to get as much building material as possible.
3. Dig foundation trenches.
4. Dig hole for composting toilet.
5. Build composting toilet walls.

### Finding material
1. Stones and gravel are perfect in the cob mix. It's just not comfortable to tread with bare feet[^evans-gravel].

### Jar shake tests

### Test bricks[^evans-bricks]
1. Mix a small batch of cob with the materials you intend to use, without straw.
2. Make 3 test blocks in the size of a brick (4 x 8 x 3 inches).
3. Add straw to the rest of the mix, form similar blocks.
4. Dry the bricks in the sun. It might take several days.
5. Brake one brick in half, if it's not dry yet, leave the rest a few more days.
6. Surface craking indicates too much clay.
7. Try scratching the brick with a knife. If they score deeply or crumble, they are not hard enough.
8. Try breaking a block with straw by twisting it between two hands. It should be impossible.
