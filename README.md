## Introduction

Humanity's present shape was determined by a few very specific events and decisions made in the last 12.000 years. It is possible that there are other models in which we could have ended up living. This project is both a metaphysical and a concrete exploration on the possibility of deconstructing and reconstructing all dimensions of human life.

The concrete exploration is a prescriptive step-by-step path that will take the reader from blissful ignorance to a holistic self-reliance.
